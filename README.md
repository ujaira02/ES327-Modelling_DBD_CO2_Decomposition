# ES327-Individual_Project
This study uses Fortran-based scientific computing to develop a comprehensive model of COâ‚‚ decomposition in a surface-confined plasma reactor, systematically investigating key design parameters such as electrode configuration, gas flow rates, and AC supply characteristics to optimise conversion rates and energy efficiency.

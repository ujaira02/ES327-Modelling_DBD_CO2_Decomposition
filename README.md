# ES327 Individual Project - Modelling CO₂ Decomposition In A Surface-Confined Plasma Reactor
Plasma technology for CO₂ conversion is gaining traction due to its ability to operate under mild conditions, such as room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and effectively utilise intermittent renewable energy. Plasma, an ionised gas composed of electrons, ions, and both excited and neutral molecules, creates a reactive environment ideal for converting inert CO₂, particularly when confined to a surface by an applied electric field, which enhances density and reactivity. This project used Fortran-based scientific computing to develop a comprehensive model of CO₂ decomposition in a surface-confined plasma reactor, systematically investigating key design parameters such as electrode configuration, gas flow rates, and AC supply characteristics to capture transient reactive species and complex reaction kinetics. Findings indicate that optimising operational parameters, notably higher AC voltages, tailored frequency settings, and precise electrode geometry control, can significantly improve conversion rates and energy efficiency, though further advances in material durability and reactor scalability are needed. Overall, the model offers practical guidance for refining plasma-assisted CO₂ conversion processes and lays a robust foundation for sustainable industrial applications.
